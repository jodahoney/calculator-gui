# PyQt Calculator
This is a calculator GUI built with PyQt in an effort to learn how to build interactive desktop applications.
* In this project, I utilized the Model View Controller design pattern.
Much of this project was done following along with the Real Python article guide to building a PyQt GUI calculator.
